<p>If you don't have CouchDB installed on your server, you find instructions <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Installation" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>So CCMS can access your CouchDB database you'll have to a configure an Apache proxy, create a database and a CouchDB admin account. You can do all this using the shell script <code>install.sh</code> but you can also do it <a href="https://github.com/luisgerhorst/ccms#installation" target="_blank">manually</a>.</p>

<p>Execute this line in your shell, it will do nothing without your confirmation. You'll have to enter your root password.</p>
