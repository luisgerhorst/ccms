# CCMS

CCMS is a Content-Management-System for blogs, it doesn't require any custom backend (such as PHP, Ruby on Rails or node.js). This is possible by using [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org)'s HTTP API. Another important feature is that the site dynamically loads required contents from the database using JavaScript. This means there's no reload while navigating on the blog.
	
CCMS is currently in early **ALPHA**. If you anyway want to try it just [send me a mail](mailto:luis@luisgerhorst.de) and I'll help you with the installation. Thanks!
